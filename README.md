To use download and unzip and open readme.html and select.html

A simple set of HTML and JS codes that allows you to do a radius search using Google's Places API, search by location,type and keyword. Create a list and send it to be converted to GEOJSON. 

This tool has only been tested in Chrome. Open the select.html file and enter the location you want to 
work with. Address and zip codes can be used in the first box. Search using the keyword or/and the type 
drop down list. Click search for objects and in the list at the bottom you can remove certain results if need be.
Clicking the map will move the radius bubble around allowing for additional searches. When done hit send to GEO JSOn
and a new window will open with the GEO JSON code.
